## Game Overview

Cyber Bloom: Ayra’s Quest is a 2D retro-style pixel art adventure set in a world where the balance between nature and technology has been shattered. Once coexisting in harmony, the world now stands corrupted under the control of Dr. Virex, a rogue scientist who merged machines with animals and transferred his consciousness into a cybernetic frog. With his sinister hybrid army and a powerful corrupted code, he controls both mechanical beings and once-peaceful creatures. Ayra, the protagonist, embarks on a journey to restore the world and defeat Virex.

## Core Gameplay Loop

Players control Ayra through:

- Exploration: Move across diverse pixel art environments  
- Combat: Use Bullets to defeat cyber enemies  
- Collection: Gather Orbs (for health) and stars (for ammo)  
- Puzzle Solving: Answer riddles or interact with objects to progress  
- Boss Battles: Confront powerful enemies at the end of each level

This loop is repeated across three unique levels, each with increasing difficulty and narrative development.

## Controls and Mechanics

Ayra begins with limited health (hearts). Collecting five orbs restores one heart. Each star collected provides 10 bullets. These systems encourage both exploration and careful resource management.

## Narrative and Emotional Drive

The game’s emotional core lies in Ayra’s mission to restore harmony. As the last hope, she sets out to break Dr. Virex’s control and free the natural world from corruption.

Opening monologue:  
"The world was once in balance... technology and nature, living side by side in harmony. But one man—Dr. Virex—wanted more. He merged machines with animals, creating terrifying hybrids. Then he did the unthinkable... he transferred his mind into a cybernetic frog. Now, he's controlling animals and all the robots through his corrupted code. I’m Ayra, and I’m humanity’s last hope. I have to break his control... and set the world free."

Environmental storytelling reinforces this journey—flowers bloom as Ayra passes, broken machines revive, and music evolves with her progress.
